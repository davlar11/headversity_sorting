This is basically the weather forecast asp.net core w/ react frontend template.

I played around trying to understand how everything more or less works with reactjs since this is very new to me.

I created a new set of class/controller to have objects to get an idea of how to add new ones. 

I later deleted the weatherforecast one to avoid confusion when reviewing code.
